=head1 NAME

XML::Toolkit - A suit of XML tools with Antlers.

=head1 VERSION

This document describes XML::Toolkit version 0.10. 

THIS VERSION BREAKS BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use XML::Toolkit::App;
    my $loader = XML::Toolkit::App->new( xmlns => { '' => 'MyApp' } )->loader;
    $loader->parse_file( $$file );
    print join '', @{ $loader->render };

or

    use XML::Toolkit::App;
    my $builder = my $builder = XML::Toolkit::App->new( xmlns => { '' => 'MyApp' } )->builder
    $builder->parse_string($xml)
    say $builder->render()

Typically you would use the C<xmltk> command line script.

    xmltk generate --input mydocument.xml --namespace MyApp
    
=head1 DESCRIPTION

XML::Toolkit is a suite of tools that work to make handling XML easier.
It is designed to marshall XML documents into Moose classes and back
again with minimal changes.

For example given a xml document like the following

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <note>
        <to>Tove</to>
        <from>Jani</from>
        <heading>Reminder</heading>
        <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
    </note>

C<XML::Toolkit> will generate classes for each of the elements. The 
C< <note> > element's class would be something like

   package MyApp::Note;
   use Moose;
   use namespace::autoclean;
   use XML::Toolkit;
   
   has 'to_collection' => (
        isa         => 'ArrayRef[MyApp::To]',
        is          => 'ro',     
        init_arg    => 'tos',
        traits      => [qw(XML Array)],
        lazy        => 1,
        auto_deref  => 1,
        default     => sub { [] },
        handles    => { add_to => ['push'] },     description => {
           Prefix => "",
           LocalName => "to",
           node_type => "child",
           Name => "to",
           NamespaceURI => "",
           sort_order => 0,
        },
   );
  
   has 'from_collection' => (
        isa         => 'ArrayRef[MyApp::From]',
        is          => 'ro',     
        init_arg    => 'froms',
        traits      => [qw(XML Array)],
        lazy        => 1,
        auto_deref  => 1,
        default     => sub { [] },
        handles    => { add_from => ['push'] },     description => {
           Prefix => "",
           LocalName => "from",
           node_type => "child",
           Name => "from",
           NamespaceURI => "",
           sort_order => 1,
        },
   );
   
   has 'body_collection' => (
        isa         => 'ArrayRef[MyApp::Body]',
        is          => 'ro',     
        init_arg    => 'bodys',
        traits      => [qw(XML Array)],
        lazy        => 1,
        auto_deref  => 1,
        default     => sub { [] },
        handles    => { add_body => ['push'] },     description => {
           Prefix => "",
           LocalName => "body",
           node_type => "child",
           Name => "body",
           NamespaceURI => "",
           sort_order => 2,
        },
   );
   
   has 'heading_collection' => (
        isa         => 'ArrayRef[MyApp::Heading]',
        is          => 'ro',     
        init_arg    => 'headings',
        traits      => [qw(XML Array)],
        lazy        => 1,
        auto_deref  => 1,
        default     => sub { [] },
        handles    => { add_heading => ['push'] },     description => {
           Prefix => "",
           LocalName => "heading",
           node_type => "child",
           Name => "heading",
           NamespaceURI => "",
           sort_order => 3,
        },
   );
   
   1;
   __END__

You can then use the set of classes to load the original document, or
create new documents that match this structure.

    my $document = MyApp::Note->new(
        to_collection => [MyApp::To->new(text => 'Bob')],
        from_collection => [MyApp::From->new(text => 'Alice')],
        headings => [MyApp::Heading->new(text => 'Secret' )],
        body_collection => [MyApp::Body->new(text=>'Shh!')],
    )
    
    my $generator = XMLTK::App->new( xmlns => { '' => '' } )->generator;
    $generator->render_object($root);
    my $output = join( '', $generator->output );
    
    # output
    #    
    # <note>
    #     <to>Bob</to>
    #     <from>Alice</from>
    #     <heading>Secret</heading>
    #     <body>Shhh!</body>
    # </note>

The original intention of XML::Toolkit was to round-trip XML documents
with an unkonwn schema through an editor and back out to disk with very
few semantic or structural changes.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Currently XML::Toolkit only supports Auto-Discovery of class hierarchy from
XML instances, and does not know anything about DTDs, RelaxNG, XML-Schema or
anything else. Future work is being considered in this, and patches may be
accepted if they come with documentation and tests.

Please report any bugs or feature requests to C<bug-xml-toolkit@rt.cpan.org>,
or through the web interface at L<http://rt.cpan.org>. Additional support may
be available via C<#xml-toolkit> on C<irc.perl.org>.
