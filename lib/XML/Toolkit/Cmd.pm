=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Currently XML::Toolkit only supports Auto-Discovery of class hierarchy from
XML instances, and does not know anything about DTDs, RelaxNG, XML-Schema or
anything else. Future work is being considered in this, and patches may be
accepted if they come with documentation and tests.

Please report any bugs or feature requests to C<bug-xml-toolkit@rt.cpan.org>,
or through the web interface at L<http://rt.cpan.org>. Additional support may
be available via C<#xml-toolkit> on C<irc.perl.org>.
